<p class="important">Only 5 slots are available for online participation. Please note that online attendees may receive limited teaching support, especially during hands-on sessions, as remote debugging of Modelica code can be challenging. Priority for online participation will be given to candidates based in non-European countries and/or those requiring a visa to enter Denmark.
