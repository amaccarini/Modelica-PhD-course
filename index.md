# Modelica-based simulation of building and district energy systems
{: .fs-7 .mb-2 }
{{ site.tagline }}
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This course aims to present latest developments in modeling and simulation of building and district energy systems based on Modelica modeling language. Modelica is an open-source language that features ease of use, visual design of models with combination of Lego-like predefined blocks, ability to define model libraries with reusable components, and support for modeling and simulation of complex applications involving parts from different engineering domains.

The course is organized in three days. In the first day, the course gives a basic introduction of Modelica fundamentals by introducing object-oriented and equation-based modeling. In the second day, the concepts previously learnt are used to develop a building model equipped with a radiator system and an air-based cooling system. In the third day, a district heating system model will be developed by connecting substations, piping network and central plant.

### Target audience:
The course is directed towards PhD students who aim to use Modelica for simulation of building and district energy systems. MSc students, academics (e.g. postdocs, researchers) and professionals from the industry are also welcome. Teaching will be provided as a mix of lecture presentations, hands-on trainings, simulation exercises and discussions.

### Max. number of participants:
20

### Location:
Copenhagen, Denmark ([Aalborg University campus - A.C. Meyers V√¶nge 15, 2450 K√∏benhavn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aalborg+University+Copenhagen/@55.6508514,12.5419012,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x465254803001cc61:0xe7e0b8f43d4f43e7!8m2!3d55.6508514!4d12.5419012!16s%2Fm%2F0hhqstv?entry=ttu))

<p class="note">The course is designed for <strong>in-person participation</strong>. However, a limited number of slots will be available for online participation. For more info about registration and online participation, please see <a href="https://amaccarini.github.io/Modelica-PhD-course/registration/">here.</a></p>

### Fee:
The course is free for students and academics. If you are from the industry, the fee for participating in the course is 1000 EUR.

### Prerequisites:
While previous Modelica experience is not required for this course, familiarity with the following areas could enhance your understanding:
- Programming (any language)
- Building simulation programs
- Concepts of thermo-fluid dynamics and heat transfer mechanisms in buildings

### Software requirements:
Prior to the course, it is required to install the latest [Dymola trial version](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/trial-version/) (2024x Refresh 1) and the [Modelica Buildings Library](https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/download.html) (v11.0.0). The instructions to access the non-trial license will be provided at the beginning of the course. 

### Criteria for assessment:
The completion of the couse is awarded with 3 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System). Participants will be evaluated through a final assignment, which consists in the preparation of a report to be delivered 2 weeks after the end of the course.
